Stats:
  Info:
    About: |-
      Below you'll find information on what's considered a statistic by Kiera:

      This Server Has Stats: `{{serverState}}`
      Your Stats are Currently: `{{userState}}`
      Your Stats Entries (From all servers): `{{count}}`

      **These statistics consist of:**
        - Date & Time
        - Server ID
        - Channel ID
        - User ID
        - Type of statistic (Action seen, Example: Message, Server Join, Reaction, Name of Command used, etc)
        - If its a Kiera command it will contain only the command name & the success state

      **These Statistics do not contain:**
        - Message body (nothing that's contained within the message body, Text, Image, URL, etc)
        - Message ID
        - The outcome body of any commands
        - User or Nicknames
        - Anything in DMs where Kiera is not present

      **About Disabling Statistics:**
        - At the User level: None of these stats will be recorded (inc: Server or Channel)
        - At the Channel level: No stats on the channel or users will be recorded within that channel
        - At the Server level: No stats recorded on the server (inc: Channel or User)

  Channel:
    Disabled: |-
      All stats have now been **Disabled** for this channel.

      - If you wish to delete all recorded stats to date you can run the following command `{{prefix}}stats delete channel`.

      - When channel statistics are disabled but not deleted they may still appear on Server or User statistics.
      - The `{{prefix}}stats channel` command will now be disabled for this channel.

      For more information about Statistics, see the `{{prefix}}stats about` command output.
